// Im gonna make a story game about an adventurer who got teleported in to a tower that has different levels and you have to find a way out
// Firstly i need to make different choices like names and paths to choose.
// Than i need to make different endings so i have a game that is playable. 
// I think im going to make about 10 or more endings with different ways to achieve them.
// but first 3 endings an go to 10 endings.
// after i have made the endings and story im going to make improvements like maybe some items and damage systems.
// some improvements on the map maybe a type of map that you can check where you have went or what paths youve gone on.
